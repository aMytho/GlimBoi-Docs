## How much does GlimBoi cost?

GlimBoi is free and open source.

## Can I run GlimBoi?

GlimBoi can run on windows and linux devices. On average it uses about 100mb of RAM. The CPU usage will be very low. Glimboi can run on Mac but you have to build it yourself.

## Why is my viewer not earning points for watchtime?

To save resources Glimboi distributes points/watchtime every 15 minutes. This means that if you check your watchtime at 5 mintues it will be the same at 10 minutes. At 15 minutes all stats are added.

## How do I resize the bot?

Click and drag the blue navigation bar on the top of the screen. Move the window down. Then click on the edges of the window and resize normally.
