## Events Overview

Glimboi can start various events. Events can be joined by viewers in chat. Multiple events can run at the same time. All events have settings on the event page to modify for your stream. Enjoy!

## Raffle

Glimboi can start a raffle. The bot will pick one winner. A raffle can be started on the events page or by typing !raffle in chat. Viewers can enter the raffle with !enter . You can view the list of participants on the events page. It will live update. After a minute has passed Glimboi will announce the winner to chat. The winner can also be viewed on the events page if it is currently open.
*Note that if you leave the events page the winner will be removed!*

## Poll

Glimboi can poll the chat to get viewer feedback. A poll can be started from the GUI. Enter the question and any options. Polls can also be started from chat.

!poll QUESTION? option 1 | option 2 | option 3 .

Ensure that you end the question with a ? and separate the choices with | .

You can view the results live on the events page. The results will be sent to chat at the end of the poll.
