## Events Overview

Glimboi can start various events. Events can be joined by viewers in chat. Multiple events can run at the same time.

## Raffle

Glimboi can start a raffle. The bot will pick one winner. A raffle can be started on the events page or by typing !raffle in chat. Viewers can enter the raffle with !enter . You can view the list of participants on the events page. It will live update. After a minute has passed Glimboi will announce the winner to chat. The winner can also be viewed on the events page if it is currently open. 
*Note that if you leave the events page the winner will be removed!*

## Poll

Glimboi can poll the chat to get viewer feedback. A poll can be started from the GUI. Enter the question and any options. Polls can also be started from chat.

!poll QUESTION? option 1 | option 2 | option 3 . 

Ensure that you end the question with a ? and separate the choices with | . 

You can view the results live on the events page. The results will be sent to chat at the end of the poll.

## GlimRealm

Glimrealm is a spin inspired chat game with a glimdrop twist. Start by typing:

!glimrealm

Once the game has started:

!portal

Every viewer that enters will have one random event. You will lose or gain points based on the event. There are a lot of possible outcomes.

## Bankheist

Bankheist works nearly the same as other bankheist games. Start with:

!bankheist

Others can join with !bankheist

You need at least 2 members to begin. Once started random events will occur. Some will be more risky than others. At the end of the heist all members who escaped will be rewarded with channel currency.
