## Currency Overview

Viewers can become users in GlimBoi. Once they are added as a user they can start to earn currency. Every 15 minutes the bot will check if the user has spoken in chat. If the user has been active Glimboi will give the user a set amount of points. These points can be used for features within the bot.

## Currency Settings

You can change the amount of points that a user starts with. You can also change how many points are earned if the user is active in chat. The name of your currency can also be adjusted.

## Give/Take Currency

You can edit a users points on the users page. Select "Edit User". Enter the name of the user. Now you can edit the points of the user. When the rank system is completed mods will be able to adjust this from the chat.
