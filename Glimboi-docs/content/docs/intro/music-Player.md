## Music Player

Glimboi can play local music files on your system. Simply head to the music player and choose the folder or song to be played. It will start playing on that tab.

> For folder playback it searches downward recursivly which means it scans other folders within the top folder.

## Chat Attribution

Glimboi can send the current song to chat when it starts to play. Must be enabled in settings. It will outout the name and artist if it is in the metadata.

## Now Playing Overlay

Glimboi will display the overlay when a song starts playing. It can be found on the music page in the overlay button. Add the file provided into obs as a local browser source. Make sure it is enabled in settings. It wil display the logo, name, and artist if its in the metadata.

## Music Commands

You can use the player from chat! This feature is controlled by the rank system. We suggest you modify it accordingly.

All commands here must start with !song or !sr and end with the modification/query.

> Ex. !sr next, !song next. Next would be the query.

current or now => Returns what is playing.
next or n => Returns the next song.
last or l => Returns the last song.
skip => Skips to the next song.
previous => Skips to the last song.
repeat or loop => Toggles the loop setting.
