## Windows

Windows supports automatic updates. On lanch GlimBoi checks for a new update. It will be downloaded in the background and applied on closing. If something is not working properly you can download the next update manually on the releases page. 

## Linux

Linux does not support automatic updates. GlimBoi will try to notify you when a new update is released. You can go to the  releases page to download the new version.

> Note that with any manual update you must select the same installation directory to save your data.
