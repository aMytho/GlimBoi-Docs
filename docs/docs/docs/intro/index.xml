      <description>Currency Overview Viewers can become users in GlimBoi. Once they are added as a user they can start to earn currency. Every 15 minutes the bot will check if the user has spoken in chat. If the user has been active Glimboi will give the user a set amount of points. These points can be used for features within the bot.
Currency Settings You can change the amount of points that a user starts with.</description>

      <description>Settings Overview Glimboi has a few settings to help you customize the bot for your stream.
Cooldown Glimboi will apply a cooldown to all commands. This prevents viewers from spamming the chat with commands. This applies to ALL commands, not just one command being repeated. Below is an example of how this might work.
30 second cooldown -
!info - Sent to chat
 5 seconds later  !other - Not sent to chat</description>
