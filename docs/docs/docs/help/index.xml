      <description>Windows Windows supports automatic updates. On lanch GlimBoi checks for a new update. It will be downloaded in the background and applied on closing. If something is not working properly you can download the next update manually on the releases page.
Linux Linux does not support automatic updates. GlimBoi will try to notify you when a new update is released. You can go to the releases page to download the new version.</description>
