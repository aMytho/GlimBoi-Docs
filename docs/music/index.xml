Simply head to the music player and choose the folder or song to be played. It will start playing on that tab.
For folder playback it searches downward recursivly which means it scans other folders within the top folder.
Music Commands You can use the player from chat! This feature is controlled by the rank system. We suggest you modify it accordingly.</description></item><item><title>File and Overlay</title><link>https://glimboi.com/docs/music/music-overlay/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://glimboi.com/docs/music/music-overlay/</guid><description>Music Overlay Glimboi has a built in overlay to show the current song.
