Start by downloading the installation file for your plaltform (.exe for windows and .deb for linux). Windows users can run the .exe file and choose where the bot will be installed. Linux users will need a package manager that can run .deb files. GDebi will work for this.
Windows users will likely see a warning since Glimboi is not registered with the Windows system.
Authorization GlimBoi requires authentication to talk as a bot/streamer account.</description></item><item><title>Joining Chat</title><link>https://glimboi.com/docs/intro/joiningchat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glimboi.com/docs/intro/joiningchat/</guid><description>Glimesh Channels Glimboi can join any channel on Glimesh.
