Reloading the bot (CTRL+R) may prove helpful.
Why are commands not working? Ensure the cooldown is turned off or at a low rate. Check that you have the required rank to run the command. You may also need points to run the command. Most of these conditions will alert you in chat if they are not met. You can also check the state of the command (disabled or enabled) as well as the relevant triggers.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://glimboi.com/docs/help/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glimboi.com/docs/help/faq/</guid><description>Since Glimesh is closing, what will happen to the bot and my data? In short, nothing! Glimboi will not be receiving any more updates. Your data will stay on your PC unless you delete it. If you plan on using a custom instance of Glimesh (or a self-hosted one), the bot will support that. However, updates to the custom instances may break compatibility with the bot.
If you will not be using a custom instance, feel free to export your data(optional) and uninstall the bot.</description></item></channel></rss>
